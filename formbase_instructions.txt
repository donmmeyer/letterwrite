HOW TO MAKE TEMPLATES

Make as many templates as you can to be placed in the formbase folder.  Make a lot of templates so that you have something as close as possible to the letter you are likely to write.
Make the name the function of the letter for example:  

       Client Representation.docx   or  Personal Injury Notice of Claim.docx


Use  old word documents that you already have written.  Change the  date, names, and incidents like this. 

* say for the recipient, make changes in the document like this.  

  [Recipient Name]  
  [Recipient's Title or Company Name]

  For time frame put this --[insert timeframe, e.g., 14 days] 

  For other particulars make it general and put it within square brackets like this [  ].
