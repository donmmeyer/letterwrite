1. Start anaconda prompt under Windows prompt.  Download anaconda, if needed. 

- to download anaconda:  https://www.anaconda.com/download

2. Create openai key, if needed.   https://platform.openai.com/  See below.
Put Environment variable in 'Search'
Create System environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY and copy key there.

3.  Download https://github.com/donmmeyer/letterwrite using 'Code' button.
Copy to Download folder. After you unzip it, take the copy all the inside to the letterwrite-main folder and ctrl-A to select all, copy, then paste into the location 
where you want it. Put the files at the location where you will run it.

The location could be C:\Users\John\Python\letterwrite for example, but you can put it other places.

3. Create environment at that location.
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate

4. Copy letterwrite-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl to location. And install: 
  pip install letterwrite-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

5. Where did it get installed?  
  pip show -f letterwrite


6. Then run: python install.py 
- check to see if the contents of formbase, contacts, and log folders were copied.  If not then probably the environment was not created in the letterwrite folder.

7. Now invoke by running the program at the location where you installed:  letterwrite

8. Test it.
